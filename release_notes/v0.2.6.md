The app has been renamed to QLoader to avoid confusion.

- List of all errors that caused download failure
- Quest Pro support (untested)
- "--disable-gpu" launch argument. You can use it if you experience graphical issues

### Fixed
- Wrong device name for Quest 1 in device info panel
- "Install trailers addon" button throwing task enqueuing error
- Sorting by update status not working
- Poor adb pulling speeds on Linux
- Crash on drag and dropping invalid APK

### Other changes
