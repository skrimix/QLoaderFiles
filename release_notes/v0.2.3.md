This hotfix release addresses several issues introduced in v0.2.2

### Fixed
- Wrong url in game download reporting
- Apk info reading errors potentially caused by ApkNet bug (reverted to using aapt2)
- Drag and dropping apk file from downloads folder when "Delete after install" is enabled causing task to get stuck on "Deleting downloaded files"
